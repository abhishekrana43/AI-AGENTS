AI-AGENTS

A learning project focused on building AI agents using JavaScript/TypeScript, the OpenAI SDK, and modern tool integrations such as MCP (Model Context Protocol).
This repo explores different patterns, architectures, and experiments for designing autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents.


🚀 Overview

.This project is a hands-on exploration of:

.Building AI agents using OpenAI’s API (new JS/TS SDK)

.Designing agent toolchains and workflows

.Working with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers & clients

.Using structured output, function calling, and tool execution

.Experimenting with planning, memory (optional), and multi-step reasoning

.Integrating external APIs, filesystem tools, custom tool hosts, etc.

.The goal is to understand modern agent architecture and implement practical examples—from simple chat agents to multi-tool autonomous flows.

📦 Tech Stack

-Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)

-OpenAI SDK (2024+)

-MCP (Model Context Protocol)

-Optional tools:

-REST APIs

-Vector stores

-File-based memory

-Web scraping libraries

-Task runners

-Local tools via MCP server

🧩 Features (Planned & Current)

 -Basic chat agent using OpenAI responses

 -Function-calling examples for tool-enabled agents

 -MCP client setup & custom tool server

 -Agent with multiple tools and planning mode

 -Agent that interacts with the filesystem

 -Workflow-style agent (multi-step tasks)

 CLI interface for running agents

 Agent templates (research agent, coding agent, task-runner agent)
